## What is a Digital Service team?
_Yeah um er_

## Mission
To bring together digital service teams across state, provincial, local, Indigenous, territorial, and tribal (SPLITT) governments and enable collaboration amongst members, sharing of best practices, development of connections, and advocacy for innovation across.

## Who We Are
A group of teams in state, provincial, local, Indigenous, territorial, and tribal (SPLITT) governments that are using data, technology, and human-centered design to improve the delivery of services for their respective communities and constituents.

## About (from one pager)
The Beeck Center’s Digital Service Network (DSN) supports government Digital Service and IT teams to directly improve how public services are designed and delivered. Across North America and worldwide, governments are beginning or growing their digital transformation efforts. Service delivery supported by innovation and digital service teams incorporates roles such as user researchers, human-centered designers, product managers, open-source software developers, and data scientists. As these government digital service teams pioneer new approaches to service delivery, there is much to learn from their implementation methods. 

The DSN is a supported community of practice that fosters collaboration and maximizes the capacity of Digital Service teams. With co-designed and peer-based resource sharing, policy advocacy, training, and technical assistance, digital service is being institutionalized as core to the way governments work to serve people. While the government digital service teams are focused on building their services and methodologies, there is an opportunity to document their work in order to learn from these experiences, share lessons and best practices more widely, and support digital service teams as they adapt to evolving public needs.

## What We Do (from partners one pager)
The Beeck Center’s DSN provides expertise in using technology, data, and design to improve delivery of public services. We offer community management and facilitation, conduct research to lift up insights, amplify cross-sector projects and publications, and build capacity for targeted advocacy of shared messages and goals. Specifically, here’s how the Digital Service Network helps those teams and their governments succeed:

* Advising the transition teams and new administrations of state and local elected officials, to  understand whether and how they should go about starting or supporting digital service teams in their governments. (Fall 2022 is a particularly opportune moment for such guidance, with 36 gubernatorial elections and 30+ mayoral elections in mid-to-large cities.)
* Regular convenings and basic communications tools for ongoing discussions and knowledge-sharing, starting with a mailing list and a real-time collaboration service.
* A library of useful and reusable materials, including digital service job descriptions (many of which do not yet exist in state and local governments’ HR files), working team charters, budgets and supporting documentation, project selection rubrics, organizational charts, team values statements, digital service career progression frameworks, recruitment materials, pre- and post-award procurement documents, digital service standards, and assessment guides.
* A mentorship network across jurisdictions, to help teams in smaller jurisdictions to skill up.
* Research and writing, including case studies, playbooks, best practice guides, and other forms of guidance targeted at new, emerging, and more mature DS teams.

We have consulted with North America’s leaders in this field—Chief Digital Officers and executive directors of digital service and innovation teams who have been delivering and transforming government digital services for the last several years. While there have been limited, irregular opportunities for these leaders to connect, commiserate, problem-solve and share with each other, we believe, and we agree, that their work—and the work of many state and local governments that may be considering establishing such teams—would benefit greatly from a more formally organized, resourced, ongoing, and lasting network, built specifically for digital service teams and their leaders, rooted in the kind of leverage an international university like Georgetown can provide.

## About the Beeck Center (from report)
The Beeck Center is an experiential hub at Georgetown University that trains students and incubates scalable, leading edge ideas for social change. We believe impact at scale requires the courage to think and behave differently. Our work centers on investing in outcomes for individuals and society. We equip future global leaders with the mindset to promote outcome-driven solutions, using the tools of design, data, technology, and innovation. We convene actors across the public, private, and civic sectors to advance new tools, frameworks, and approaches necessary to achieve these outcomes.
