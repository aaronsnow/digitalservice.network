## About the Office of Innovation
Founded with the mandate to improve the lives of New Jerseyans by designing and deploying more effective and efficient government services, the Office of Innovation works in partnership with the Governor’s office, State agencies, and outside partners to create innovative policies and technologies that address complex public problems by working differently. We apply data science and public engagement to understand problems, and use the latest digital technologies combined with strategic policies to develop solutions that improve services while also reducing costs for the State and the taxpaying public.

### Principals we innovate by:
-   Build with New Jerseyans, putting them at the center of our work    
-   Solve problems by breaking down silos and forming partnerships - across teams, departments, agencies, levels of government, and with external experts    
-   Deliver accessible solutions and policies that meet the needs of real people    
-   Succeed in a highly ambiguous environment with little definition or structure
