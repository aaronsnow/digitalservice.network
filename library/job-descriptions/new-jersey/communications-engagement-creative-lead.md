## Communications + Engagement Creative Lead
We are seeking to hire an experienced advertising and marketing strategy professional looking to use their skills to serve. This role will co-lead an exciting new initiative to build a best-in-class team to transform the delivery and promotion of key government services, programs, and initiatives through the use of research- and data-driven best practices. This position will help lead the creation of a new team empowered to strengthen the State’s ability to reach its diverse constituents by honing and delivering messaging with greater speed and agility, crafting creative and effective messaging that resonates with the public, and yielding more impactful outcomes.

As a member of a small team, this is both a leadership and strategy role as well as an executional role. Visionary ambition is a must, as is a willingness to execute the day-to-day work needed to turn a concept into impact. Operating closely with a small team, this role will work in partnership with the Office of the Governor and State departments and agencies through various models of collaboration to bolster public awareness campaigns, and cultivate and leverage owned-media channels such as mass email, SMS, and other direct-to-consumer engagement tools. You should be comfortable working in a startup environment where you think independently and operate with a high degree of autonomy.

This is a full-time role with hybrid and remote work opportunities.

### As a part of the team, you will:
-   Help lead the creation of a new team empowered to strengthen the State’s ability to reach its diverse constituents by honing and delivering compelling, trustworthy information with speed and agility, crafting creative and effective messaging that resonates with the public, and yielding more impactful outcomes    
-   First and foremost, be a creator and a writer that crafts compelling concepts and copy that drive action and outcomes
-   Work closely with team members and across State agencies to conceptualize, develop, and deliver strategic and creative copy content and communications for a range of campaigns (print, digital, on-air) as well as social media content, blog posts, web copy, and other advertising elements    
-   Write, edit, and/or proofread additional written materials, including, but not limited to, creative strategy briefs, press materials, messaging documents, and strategy memorandums    
-   Brainstorm innovative ideas that engage audiences and capture attention, while still delivering clear messaging and driving action    
-   In partnership with the Strategy lead and other team members, work with departmental partners to produce, develop and hone creative ideas, collateral, messaging, and approaches that are rooted in data, research, and culture    
-   Partner and collaborate with outside communications and behavioral science experts in academia and industry to inform the creation of messaging, and message delivery    
-   Work with inter- and cross-agency teams to develop project budgets and timelines    
-   Conduct other duties as required
    
### You should possess the following:
-   Creative genius and the track record to prove it: a minimum of 7+ years experience in creative direction, copywriting, content creation, marketing, strategic branding, editorial writing, speechwriting and copy editing; advertising, marketing, and/or public affairs agency experience greatly preferred; senior executives are also encouraged to apply
-   The ability to translate information into equitable impact: demonstrated success in taking informed strategic approaches and transforming them into compelling work product that resonates with and moves diverse target audiences   
-   Patience and persistence: a strong desire to iterate, evolve, and work collaboratively with inside and outside expertise to help you create the best work product possible    
-   The willingness and desire to both lead and “do”: as a leading member of a small team, you’ll be interfacing with principals and pitching them on your creative work, but you’ll also be handling the administrative aspects of creating that work    
-   A strong sense of empathy: the ability to work as a productive, inclusive, and aware team member
    
Compensation: Dependent on experience
