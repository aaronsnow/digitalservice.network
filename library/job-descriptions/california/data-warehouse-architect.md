# Data Warehouse Architect    
A Data Warehouse Architect designs data warehouse architectures to support organizational goals. They understand how to build data warehouse models that can optimally serve BI and analytic needs. They can evaluate the tradeoffs of different schema implementations (e.g., star schema vs. snowflake schema), consider data throughput constraints, and propose a best fit architecture and infrastructure for the defined problem.

A Data Warehouse Architect must be able to work with subject matter experts across programs, divisions, policy areas, and levels of knowledge. They work with data modelers, analysts, program and technical staff to collaboratively define data needs and technical constraints that can influence the warehouse architecture design. These can include requirements of data timeliness, location of source data, latency of connections to data centers, and the amount of data to name some but not all considerations.

A Data Warehouse Architect will be familiar with ETL/ELT approaches, and while they won’t have to implement ETL/ELT, they will have to propose warehousing approaches that fit with the defined ETL/ELT framework or work with data engineers to define an optimal approach.

A Data Warehouse Architect should be able to model data primarily for dimensional models, but be able to interpret data models for relational and/or NoSQL databases to appropriately map source data to the warehouse target schema. They should be proficient in using tools to develop and iterate on dimensional models (e.g., Power Designer, DAX Studio, ERWin, ER/Studio, etc.) and SQL.

## Experience
This Classification must have a minimum of five (5) years of relevant experience in data modeling, database design, and warehouse architecture.

## And Education
This classification requires the possession of a bachelor’s or advanced degree in computer science, engineering, math or related field. Additional qualifying experience may be substituted for the required education on a year-for-year basis.
