# Analyst    
An Analyst is familiar with a range of digital/web services and solutions, ideally where open source and cloud technologies and various development methodologies have been applied; has an eye for detail, excellent communication skills, and ability to rationalize complex information to make it understandable for others to work; and ability to interrogate reported information and challenge sources where inconsistencies are found.

The Analyst will support agencies by analyzing propositions and assessing decision-making factors such as strategic alignment, cost/benefit, and risk; work closely with the Product Manager to define a product approach to meet user needs; define skill requirements and map internal, agency, and external (partners/specialist contractors) resources; work with the owning agency to ensure they have the budget to cover the proposed approach and resource requirements during delivery and analyze what provision they have for ongoing running costs; analyze and map the risks of this product approach and propose mitigation solutions; define how the predicted user and financial benefit can be realized, and how channel shift will be measured; and make a recommendation for action against the analysis done.

The Analyst will possess knowledge and experience in ensuring enhanced processes and services are technically, operationally, and legally supported by analyzing and compiling requirements and solidifying successful implementation; strengthening risk mitigation techniques and improved process efficiencies while meeting stringent regulatory requirements; developing, coordinating, and implementing methodology and scope for multiple complex projects; strong analytical and research techniques to identify gaps and inconsistencies within current measurement tools, allowing development of improved and cost-effective models; and performing requirements analysis, documentation and quality assurance for each deliverable.
