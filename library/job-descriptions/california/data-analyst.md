# Data Analyst    
A Data Analyst supports the organization by translating business initiatives and goals into analytical questions, identifying critical metrics, conducting analysis, and developing reporting. Additionally, they will help identify relevant datasets, contribute to data transformations, clean data, and conduct exploratory and statistical analyses to identify, analyze, and interpret trends or patterns in complex datasets.

A Data Analyst must be able to work with subject matter experts across programs, divisions, policy areas, and levels of knowledge. A Data Analyst must be able to derive insights that advance the business needs and that are actionable by the client. They must be able to articulate and present these insights in ways that the client understands and is able to take action on. They must be comfortable starting with ill-defined datasets and problems and helping stakeholders to unpack what will be most helpful and achievable given the data available.

The Data Analyst must also be an effective data storyteller with a strong background in written and oral communications and a demonstrated ability to translate complex concepts into actionable insights.

They work with structured data of various kinds and sizes in databases or spreadsheets, using scripting languages and/or SQL to manipulate data. They should be familiar with data modelling concepts and be able to shape and reshape data as needed. A Data Analyst will also create visualizations, reports, and present findings, using BI applications, spreadsheets, or code.

A Data Analyst also contributes to defining data quality needs to support analysis and should be proficient in profiling data to support data quality definitions. They may need to implement quality monitoring or work with others to do so and should be able to communicate the impact of data quality on analyses.

They may work with other data analysts, data scientists, data modelers, business intelligence analysts, and data engineers to define requirements to implement more complex ongoing analysis (e.g., analyses on big datasets or real time data).

They may be required to create documentation and provide training to inform stakeholders and cultivate data literacy within the organization.
