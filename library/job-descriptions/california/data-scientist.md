# Data Scientist    
A Data Scientist is responsible for analyzing, processing, and modeling data and then communicating the results to inform actionable plans and decisions for the organization. A Data Scientist will need to be able to exercise judgement on selecting the most appropriate method(s) to the analytical question and supporting data. They should be skilled at translating methods to a lay audience.

They understand the constraints of datasets and are involved in identifying relevant data sources. They are fluent in one or more data manipulation programming languages (e.g., R, Python, Scala, etc.) They are proficient at working with structured and unstructured datasets of varying sizes and complexity, with experience working in big data management and data mining.

They need to be able to organize, clean, and transform data into usable formats in order to apply the appropriate statistical models or algorithms. They are proficient at automating data collection and preprocessing of data.

They also will do analysis, including ad-hoc analysis, looking for trends and patterns across large and multiple datasets, answering specific questions, and developing and validating hypotheses. In the course of doing exploratory data analysis and sharing findings they will create visualizations and charts to further understand and communicate insights and to identify underlying data issues (missing data, poor quality, etc.) that may constrain or influence the interpretation of results. They will need to present findings to key stakeholders and demonstrate relevant domain knowledge.

They will develop, test, and implement predictive and machine-learning models and algorithms using a mix of statistical and machine learning approaches.

They may need to work with data engineers, data modelers, business intelligence analysts and IT staff to set up more complex ongoing analyses that feed dashboards or other data products.

They may be required to create documentation and provide training to inform stakeholders and cultivate data literacy within the organization.
