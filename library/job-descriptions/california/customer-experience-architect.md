# Customer Experience Architect    
A Customer Experience Architect designs and tests processes to capture, understand and respond to feedback that’s both internal from employees and external from customers and stakeholders. They are concerned both with creating a voice of the customer function and operationalizing insights and experiments back into the program or project. They design and organize processes and information around the customer – who they are and what their needs are, and then integrate customer data to create useful insights that are shared across the right teams and increasingly interwoven with the fabric of the project or program.

A Customer Experience Architect must be able to collaborate with customers, data engineers, analysts, and subject matter experts with a variety of skills from different disciplines to create delightful customer journey experiences and to define and build requirements for datasets and processes. The ability to map requirements on to an efficient and clear design to facilitate decision-making is necessary. Expertise in ETL/ELT, data profiling, and other data quality tools and approaches are strongly preferred to design the experience customers need across key interactions and processes.

A Customer Experience Architect may also be involved in the identification of datasets with lines of business, particularly around a project or program need. They will need to work closely with management, analysts, data modelers, and IT staff to design and test proposed solutions and architectures that meet customer and business needs.

A Customer Service Architect should be fluent in one or more data manipulation languages as well as service design.

While they should have some proficiency in code and best practices in engineering management, they should primarily be comfortable implementing in low-code ETL/ELT platforms if that is the more sustainable approach for the organization.
