A Senior Data Analyst leads work to enable stakeholders across the organization by translating initiatives and goals into analytical questions, identifying critical metrics, conducting analysis, developing reporting, and leading efforts to uncover levers that could improve decision making and program outcomes. Additionally, they will work with staff to identify relevant datasets, contribute to data transformations, clean data, and conduct exploratory and statistical analyses to identify, analyze, and interpret trends or patterns in complex datasets.

A Senior Data Analyst must be able to work with subject matter experts across programs, divisions, policy areas, and levels of knowledge. A Data Analyst must be able to derive insights that advance the needs and that are actionable by the client. They must be able to articulate and present these insights in ways that the client understands and is able to take action on. They must be comfortable starting with ill-defined datasets and problems and helping stakeholders to unpack what will be most helpful and achievable given the data available.

The Senior Data Analyst must also be an effective data storyteller with a strong background in written and oral communications and a demonstrated ability to translate complex concepts into actionable insights.

A Senior Data Analyst will also create visualizations, reports, and present findings, using BI applications, spreadsheets, or code. They will also provide mentorship, expertise and feedback to other analysts and help establish standards for analytical work.

A Senior Data Analyst also informs the organization of data quality challenges and can recommend interventions (technical, policy or organizational) for maintaining necessary quality to support analysis. They have competencies to work across different aspects of projects to inform how data is captured, stored and managed to enable manipulation and analysis. They may need to implement quality monitoring or work with others to do so and should be able to communicate the impact of data quality on analyses.

They may work with data scientists, data modelers, business intelligence analysts, and data engineers to define requirements to implement more complex ongoing analysis (e.g., analyses on big datasets or real time data).

They may be required to create documentation and provide training to inform stakeholders and cultivate data literacy within the organization.
