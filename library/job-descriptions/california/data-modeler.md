# Data Modeler
A Data Modeler designs and implements data modeling solutions using relational, dimensional, and NoSQL databases depending on need. They work closely with data architects to design databases or data warehouses using a mixture of conceptual, physical, and logical data models. They are concerned with models that can improve the interoperability of data among systems and improve the performance of underlying data queries and data movement that feed applications.

A Data Modeler must be able to work with subject matter experts across programs, divisions, policy areas, and levels of knowledge. They must lead working groups and stakeholder meetings for data specifications and know the appropriate level of specificity to model at different stages of a project from conceptual to logical to physical. They perform research with technical staff and data users to determine the ideal interfaces for implementation of future technical systems.

A Data Modeler may be involved in the evaluation of existing data systems, including constructing as-is data models (where they are not already documented) and identifying foundational data model issues that could affect the efficient and effective use of data (e.g., slow queries, poorly validated data, unnecessary duplication of data, etc.) They may also do hands-on troubleshooting to optimize data system query performance where appropriate.

A Data Modeler works with the project delivery team to define risks and tradeoffs related to different design choices and to help the organization make informed decisions about implementation options for new or rebuilt systems. And they may also contribute by identifying options for architecture, infrastructure, and interfaces to data sources that enable appropriate use by lines of business.

They may also define and set up governance for data modeling and design standards, tools, best practices, and related development for enterprise data models, so that work can be repeatable across projects and programs. This is dependent on the program's needs.

A Data Modeler should be comfortable modeling data for relational, dimensional, and NoSQL databases; however, they may be focused on modeling in one more than the others depending on the project context. They should be proficient in data modeling and query analysis tools (e.g., Power Designer, DAX Studio, ERWin, ER/Studio, etc.) and SQL.

## Experience
This Classification must have a minimum of three (3) years of relevant experience in data modeling.

## And Education
This classification requires the possession of a bachelorâ€™s or advanced degree in computer science, engineering, math or related field. Additional qualifying experience may be substituted for the required education on a year-for-year basis.
