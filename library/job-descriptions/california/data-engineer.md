# Data Engineer    
A Data Engineer supports the inventorying, gathering, cleaning, processing, and programming of automated datasets and data pipelines for use by analysts and others. They are also concerned with clear documentation and work with analysts and others to ensure the output datasets are well-defined for use.

A Data Engineer must be able to work with analysts and subject matter experts to define and build requirements for automated datasets, including but not limited to defining business transformations, validation rules, and frequency of updates. The ability to map the requirements on to an efficient and sustainable solution is necessary. Expertise in ETL/ELT, data profiling, and other data quality tools and approaches is required.

A Data Engineer may also be involved in the identification of datasets with lines of business, particularly around a project or program need. They may be involved in helping to make a catalog of raw datasets accessible to analysts, data scientists and others for more exploratory analysis to inform the development of data products and services. They will need to work closely with analysts, data scientists, data modelers, warehouse architects, and IT staff to design and implement proposed solutions and architectures that meet business needs.

A Data Engineer should be fluent in one or more data manipulation languages with an emphasis on frameworks appropriate for production code and depending on need (e.g., Java, Scala, Python, Advanced SQL, etc.) They should also be able to implement data automations within existing frameworks as opposed to writing one off scripts.

While they should have proficiency in code, they should also be comfortable implementing in low-code ETL/ELT platforms if that is the more sustainable approach for the organization.
