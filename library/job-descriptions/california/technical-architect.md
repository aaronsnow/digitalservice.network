# Technical Architect    
A Technical Architect will serve as the manager of complex technology implementations, with an eye toward constant reengineering and refactoring to ensure the simplest and most elegant system possible to accomplish the desired need; understand how to maximize leverage of the open source community to deploy systems on Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) providers; be comfortable sharing knowledge across a multi-disciplinary team and working within various methodologies; and be a full partner in the determination of vision, objectives, and success criteria.

The Technical Architect will architect the overall system by using prototyping and proof of concepts, which may include: modern programming languages (e.g., Ruby, Python, Node.js) and web frameworks (e.g., Django, Rails), modern front-end web programming techniques (e.g., HTML5, CSS3, RESTful APIs) and frameworks (e.g., Twitter Bootstrap, jQuery), relational databases (e.g., PostgreSQL), and “NoSQL” databases (e.g., Cassandra, MongoDB), automated configuration management (e.g., Chef, Puppet, Ansible, Salt), continuous integration/deployment, and continuous monitoring solutions; use version control systems (e.g., Git and GitHub); ensure strategic alignment of technical design and architecture to meet business growth and direction, and stay on top of emerging technologies; decompose business and system architecture to support clean-interface multi-team development; develop product roadmaps, backlogs, and measurable success criteria, and write user stories (i.e., can establish a path to delivery for breaking down stories) and clearly communicate and work with stakeholders at every level.

The Technical Architect will possess knowledge and experience in analyses and development of conceptual designs and detail designs; developing JBOSS Messaging and connectivity with Spring-JMS connectivity; designing DB schema as per the requirements and in sync with the old system; implementing the daily and weekly jobs that interact with external interfaces; coordinating with business stakeholders to understand their requirements; communicate with cross-divisional personnel at both team and executive levels to understand performance measurement methodologies; and direct team members in compiling business requirements and executing project milestones.
