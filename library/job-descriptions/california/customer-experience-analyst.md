# Customer Experience Analyst    
A Customer Experience Analyst gathers and interprets data on customer needs, satisfaction, perceptions, and capacity on behalf of a program or project. They conduct surveys to collect stakeholder feedback, analyze data, perform research, and create reports that are both internal from employees and external from customers and stakeholders. They are concerned both with identifying and reporting on a voice of the customer function and surfacing insights for project or program management to operationalize back into the program or project.

They audit and analyze processes and information around the customer – who they are and what their needs are, and then integrate customer data to create useful insights that management may choose to be shared across the right teams and interwoven with the fabric of the project or program to promote operational rigor. They identify process improvement opportunities or necessary process changes for better data collection to serve the customers.

A Customer Experience Analyst must be able to collaborate with service architects/designers, data engineers, other types of analysts, and subject matter experts with a variety of skills from different disciplines for internally facing analysis, and with the stakeholders and end-users for externally facing analysis.

A Customer Experience Analyst may also be involved in the identification of datasets with lines of business, particularly around a project or program need. Experience with conflict resolution techniques, knowledge of diverse research practices and low-code platform programming skills are also preferred.

A Customer Experience Analyst should be fluent in one or more data manipulation languages as well as statistical methods, regression modeling and predictive analytics and a passion for customer experience. Knowledge in behavioral data analysis preferred.
