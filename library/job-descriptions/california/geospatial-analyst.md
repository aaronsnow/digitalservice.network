# Geospatial Analyst    
A Geospatial Analyst prepares analyses of spatial data, including but not limited to static maps, interactive maps, and other derived spatial data products. They share core competencies of a Data Analyst but will be more specialized working with spatial data and best practices around spatial visualization.

A Geospatial Analyst must be able to work with subject matter experts across programs, divisions, policy areas, and levels of knowledge. The position may benefit from specific domain knowledge to synthesize data into actionable insights based on the program’s need. Distinct from a data analyst, the geospatial analyst will be expected to hold expertise on working with spatial data and be able to leverage that expertise with stakeholders. They must be comfortable starting with ill-defined datasets and problems and helping stakeholders to unpack what will be most helpful and achievable given the data available.

A Geospatial Analyst must be able to translate business value goals into usable and useful maps, visuals, and underlying data models that support them. They work with structured data of various kinds and sizes in databases, GIS, or spreadsheets, using scripting languages, SQL and/or GIS to manipulate data. They have competencies to work across different aspects of projects to inform how data is captured, stored and managed to enable manipulation and analysis. A Geospatial Analyst will also create visualizations, reports, and present findings, using GIS or code.

They should be comfortable working with a range of statistical and analytical techniques using spatial and non-spatial data. They will demonstrate strong spatial analysis skills that could include but not be limited to: spatial aggregations and joins, neighborhood analysis (nearest neighbor, k-function, etc.), and raster analysis.

A Geospatial Analyst may need to develop strategies for working with real time and/or big spatial datasets depending on the organization’s needs. They may need to work with other analysts, data scientists, data engineers, data modelers and IT staff for more complex ongoing analyses that require live access to data but should be proficient enough to prototype and define those needs with staff.

A Geospatial Analyst must be able to work with modern open source (GRASS, QGIS, etc.) or proprietary ESRI GIS toolsets as required to perform complex spatial data analysis to support program objectives. They should be proficient in the use of current and popular commercial low code / no code cloud GIS tools (ArcGIS Online, etc.).

They may be required to create documentation and provide training to inform stakeholders and cultivate data literacy within the organization.

## Experience
This Classification must have a minimum of three (3) years of experience in geospatial analysis using GIS or geospatial frameworks. Project work should demonstrate excellence in geospatial analysis techniques and approaches.

## And Education
This classification requires the possession of a bachelor’s or advanced degree, preferably in a field using quantitative and spatial analysis methods such as geographic information systems, environmental science, planning, spatial analytics or related fields. Additional qualifying experience may be substituted for the required education on a year-for-year basis.
