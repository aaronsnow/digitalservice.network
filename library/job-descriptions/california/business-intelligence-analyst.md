# Business Intelligence Analyst    
Business Intelligence (BI) Analyst is responsible for preparing dashboards, charts, and other statistics/information from compiled datasets for use by decision makers, the public and other stakeholders. A BI Analyst enables program leaders and stakeholders with accurate and timely data to support decision-making, using a BI platform or framework to implement. They share core competencies with a data analyst but specialize in implementing analyses in the context of a BI framework.

A BI Analyst must be able to work with subject matter experts across programs, divisions, policy areas, and levels of knowledge. They must be comfortable starting with ill-defined datasets and problems and helping stakeholders to unpack what will be most helpful and achievable given the data available. Essential to this work is the development and standardization of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that are relevant to tracking a program or State organization’s success.

A BI Analyst must be able to translate business value goals into usable and useful visualizations and underlying data models that support decision-making. They work with structured data of various kinds and sizes in databases, warehouses or spreadsheets, and must have strong SQL skills and be able to work in one or multiple BI frameworks depending on need (Power BI, Tableau, Looker, etc.) They should be fluent in data modelling concepts and tools. Experience and comfort with data manipulation in other languages (Python, R, Scala, etc.) is helpful, but not always required.

A BI Analyst must be able to design user-centered dashboards and visualizations and use best practices for user interaction and interface design. They may work with other design professionals (interface designers, user researchers, etc.) to solicit feedback and improve BI products (dashboards, reports, metrics, etc.)

They may work with other analysts, data scientists, data modelers, data engineers, and warehouse architects to implement more complex data models, but ideally are capable of prototyping to assist in that work. They may also need to work with IT staff to design and implement secure and sustainable paths for data access from systems to support timely dashboards.

They may be required to create documentation and provide training to inform stakeholders and cultivate data literacy within the organization.
