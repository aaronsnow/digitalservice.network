## What you’ll be doing
The Ontario Digital Service is improving the online experience for citizens by reimagining government services. As an experience design co-op, you will help make government online services feel simple, seamless and intuitive.

On any given day, you may be designing a research plan to test the extent to which citizens can use a new digital product, conducting one-to-one interviews or usability tests, supporting our research operations efforts, or working with our product teams to tackle a user research challenge.

Our co-op students have the digital skills and enthusiasm to support Ontario’s Digital Government transformation.

### Your impact
-   You will put your curiosity into practice, approaching complex design challenges from a neutral point-of-view.    
-   You will put your organizational skills to work, playing a collaborative role in coordinating the various user research activities taking place in our labs. You may also be involved with presenting research findings to the Chief Digital Officer or any number of ministry partners.   

## What you bring to the team
-   You think digital by default and embrace new ideas that put users first in order to find the best solutions.    
-   You believe diversity and inclusion helps create the best conditions for people to achieve the best results, knowing the best ideas come from everywhere and everyone.    
-   You have a strong moral compass. You consider power dynamics, bias, and protection of privacy in all your research projects, but also know how to differentiate between high-risk research, and low-risk research.
    
### Requirements of the job
#### User research skills
-   You have experience testing your ideas early and often    
-   You understand generative and exploratory user research and when to use each method    
-   You are familiar with using a range of user research and user testing techniques (e.g. one-on-one interviews, card sorting, ethnographic studies, etc.)    
-   You can explain user research results in a way that is easy to understand and helps create empathy for the end user    
-   You can take the outputs of user research activities into product iterations    
-   You are comfortable creating visual artefacts such as presentation decks, wireframes or prototypes
    
#### UX design skills
-   You have an eye for design - this isn’t just about making things pretty, it’s about understanding how to leverage design to create a desired impact    
-   You have experience using the Adobe Creative suite    
-   You have experience using prototyping software, such as Figma, Balsamiq, Adobe XD, Sketch or InVision    
-   You can seamlessly integrate user and usability testing into prototyping development cycles   

#### Independent team player
-   You work as part of a team, but can execute tasks thoroughly and independently    
-   You anticipate issues before they happen and proactively address them    
-   You take initiative and step up to support the team, and believe that no task is too big or small!
