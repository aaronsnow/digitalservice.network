## Join us
Do your best work with the best people in digital. Help us make government simpler, faster, and better for over 14 million people across Ontario.

Join the Ontario Digital Service (ODS) as Director of Chapters, an one-of-a-kind executive role in government, responsible for building diverse, multidisciplinary teams who mobilize their tech, design, data, policy and communications expertise to deliver great products and services to people and businesses, while growing digital and data skills across the public sector.

Bring your strategic vision, digital expertise, and executive leadership experience to scale our impact and accelerate change.

As the Director of Chapters, you will be the chief advocate for our people, working with other collaborative leaders to build, enable and empower trusting teams who work in more networked ways to tackle some of government's most interesting challenges using internet-era practices. You will develop and mentor the next generation of public sector digital leaders, ensuring that people and teams have the tools, information and supports they need to deliver extraordinary results.

Your success is found in creating the conditions for a more connected, collaborative and creative organizational culture, where we use data, work in the open, are more agile, iterative and prepared to fail, set our aspirations high and, most importantly, obsess about user needs.

An effective leader in the Ontario Public Service (OPS) is anti-racist, inclusive, responsible, innovative, and collaborative. You:
-   Demonstrate authenticity, accountability and courage, model ethical behavior, are honest and can make tough choices.    
-   Lead with common purpose, embrace positive disruption, and possess a future-forward mindset.    
-   Inspire others, value continuous learning and encourage professional development and growth.    
-   Help others be their best and clear a path for great teams.    
-   Work consistently to confront bias and systemic barriers while understanding the importance of creating a more diverse and accessible workplace.
    
In this executive role, you will model a new way of working in the public sector and bring together people who are passionate about building the best-possible online experience for our fellow Ontarians.

### OPS commitment to diversity, inclusion, accessibility and anti-racism
The OPS is an innovative, responsive, and accountable public service that works hard to be diverse, anti-racist, inclusive, accessible, merit-based, respectful and equitable. Diversifying leadership teams is a top OPS priority with the goal to achieve parity with the Ontario labour force by 2025 for the most underrepresented groups (Indigenous, racialized and persons with disabilities) in leadership positions.

To advance this goal, the OPS is collecting socio-demographic information that will help to address potential barriers and achieve equity in hiring. You are requested to complete the [voluntary survey](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=KRLczSqsl0u3ig5crLWGXEcm01kkkeFGu_f74N5rh4JUM0xRMEZRWkJZMzJZU1o0TUhJOVg3SEJDMiQlQCN0PWcu) and contribute to building a more diverse, anti-racist, inclusive and accessible OPS.

The OPS invites all interested individuals to apply and encourages applications from Indigenous and racialized individuals and persons with disabilities.

Refer to the application instructions below if you require a disability-related accommodation.
