## Join us
The [Ontario Digital Service](http://docs.google.com/page/jobs-ontario-digital-service) is leading the government's digital transformation approach – working across government to leverage the capabilities of the internet age in the design and administration of our policies, products and services.

If you excel at leading in an agile work environment and want to be at the forefront of digital change, we'd love to hear from you.

### Our team
The Data Chapter is responsible for nurturing data practitioner skills, practices and capacity that ensure effective use of data to design, develop, improve and manage policies, programs and services.

The Ontario Public Service (OPS) Leadership Behaviors defines what it means to be a leader:
-   We are responsible for being leaders that demonstrate authenticity, accountability and courage.    
-   We are innovative by embracing positive disruption, having a future mindset and by developing each other, every day.    
-   We are collaborative by leading with a common purpose, being inclusive and driving people centered outcomes.
    
Note: This position is located in Toronto, however alternate work arrangements may be available. We are a remote first organization and are committed to finding the best people wherever they are.

### Diversity, inclusion, accessibility and anti-racism
The OPS is an innovative, responsive, and accountable public service that works hard to be diverse, anti-racist, inclusive, accessible, merit-based, respectful and equitable. Diversifying leadership teams is a top OPS priority with the goal to achieve parity with the Ontario labour force by 2025 for the most underrepresented groups (Indigenous, racialized and persons with disabilities) in leadership positions.

To advance this goal, the OPS is collecting socio-demographic information that will help to address potential barriers and achieve equity in hiring. You are requested to complete the voluntary survey and contribute to building a more diverse, anti-racist, inclusive and accessible OPS.

The OPS invites all interested individuals to apply and encourages applications from Indigenous and racialized individuals, and persons with disabilities.

The OPS is an accessible employer and we offer accommodation in all aspects of employment, including the recruitment process. Visit the [OPS Anti-Racism Policy](http://docs.google.com/page/ontario-public-service-anti-racism-policy) and the [OPS Diversity and Inclusion Blueprint](http://docs.google.com/page/ops-inclusion-diversity-blueprint) to learn more about the OPS commitment to advancing racial equity, diversity and inclusion.

The OPS offers employment accommodation across the recruitment process and all aspects of employment consistent with the requirements of [Ontario's Human Rights Code](http://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/ontario-human-rights-code). Refer to the application instructions below if you require a disability-related accommodation.
