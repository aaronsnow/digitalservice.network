-   Synthesizing complex information and communicating it in a way that is clear and easy to understand.

-   Government policies, standards and legislation relating to service delivery in a digital age (for example, the Digital Service Standard, the Simpler, Faster, Better Services Act)    
-   Current web trends (for example, analytics and design), and standards (for example, the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act, and WCAG 2.0 AA)    
-   Emerging trends in UX and content design to advise on strategy and lead the design and ongoing renewal of the government's web content and digital services.    

### User-Centred Design and Tools
You have expertise in applying content design principles and techniques including:

-   Journey mapping, writing user stories, content auditing and evaluation    
-   Experience working with user experience designers and user researchers to test and improve content in wireframes and prototypes    
-   Evaluating how text, user interfaces, navigation design, information architecture, and graphics work together in order to create content design improvements in digital services.
