## Ontario Digital Service
The Ontario Digital Service (ODS) is tackling complex public problems with digital approaches. We are building a people-centred approach to the design and delivery of government services, programs and policy. Our Advisors are at the heart of leading change initiatives that are creating a simpler, faster, better Ontario Public Service.

We own and support a growing number of policy files including the Simpler, Faster, Better Services Act, the Digital and Data Strategy, efforts to create a customer-centered government, and measure results driven through the [Ontario Onwards Action Plan](http://docs.google.com/page/ontario-onwards-action-plan).

As a digital policy co-op you will be directly involved in developing new, forward-looking digital policies for Ontario. On any given day you may:
-   Work on designing policy options    
-   Co-create solutions for complex public service problems    
-   Conduct research on best practices and partnerships    
-   Evaluate results    
-   Analyze and report on data    
-   Help people across government think about service delivery in a digital age.    

Our co-op students are interested in digital policy challenges, citizen expectation of government in a digital era, and have a collaborative mindset and enthusiasm.

### Your impact

You will help ensure that the work we do to deliver services for Ontarians is done using evidence, data and a relentless focus on the needs of users. Your work will help shape what policy-making looks like in a digital organization. You will guide public servants across government to understand how their programs, policies, and processes can be made better by engaging end users and following the [Digital Service Standard](http://docs.google.com/page/digital-service-standard).

You will learn how efficient and effective service design and people-centred approaches impact the way policy design and development are done across government. You will contribute evaluation and policy perspectives on digital design and delivery and provide expertise in research and analysis to support the development of change leadership approaches, strategies, and policies to create a more effective public service.

You will contribute to building a culture of open communication and participatory methods to share, critique, and improve not only our work, but our way of working. Most of all, you will inspire your colleagues across the government to improve the experience for the people of Ontario.

## What you bring to the team
-   You are enthusiastic and eager to learn.    
-   You are willing to pitch in where needed and can manage your time to provide support to a variety of different projects, with a variety of different tasks.    
-   You can familiarize yourself with the [Digital Service Standard](http://docs.google.com/page/digital-service-standard), digital and data trends, and willingly embrace new ideas that put service users first to find the best solutions.    
-   You are eager to work in new ways and understand how technology and digital approaches can impact government service delivery and the changing demand for government services.    
-   You are collaborative by nature and have experience seeking knowledge from a variety of sources and perspectives.    
-   You believe diversity and inclusion help create the best conditions for people to achieve the best results. Good government services are built to support all users and diverse perspectives, ideas and opinions are essential to doing that.

-   You have some knowledge of - or an interest in - how digital approaches and technologies (e.g. agile, people-centred design, service design, etc.) can be applied to the design, development and implementation of new forward-looking policy.    
-   You have an understanding of - or an interest in learning about - how policy can contribute to the design and delivery of responsive people-centred digital products.    
-   You have some knowledge of – or an interest in learning about – government policy making processes.
