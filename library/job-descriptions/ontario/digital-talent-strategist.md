## Join us
Join the Ontario Digital Service (ODS) and help build the teams that are delivering the future of government services.

People are at the heart of the ODS mission to ensure government works for everyone. As a member of the ODS Talent Team, you will play an important role in the attraction, engagement and retention of the ODS' greatest asset, our people.

The ODS Talent Team is unique in government, and focuses on three important streams of work:
1.  Bringing digital talent into government, bolstering digital capacity inside the public service, and creating the strategy to build and retain the talent pipeline;    
2.  Supporting that talent by being responsible for the end-to-end employee experience; and,    
3.  Reimaging the approach to government talent and people processes.
    
As part of a flexible, small and fun team, the Digital Talent Strategist role focuses on key areas in each stream of work to ensure we continue to have the right people with the right skills and supports to deliver amazing digital services. One of the immediate priorities of this role will be to pilot new approaches to sourcing talent (especially for difficult to fill roles such as developers and DevOps) and create and implement a more robust candidate engagement strategy.

We'd love to hear from candidates who are:
-   Passionate about improving the experience for employees;    
-   Have a growth mindset, always looking to try and learn new things; and,    
-   Proactive, strategic thinkers comfortable with autonomy and self-directed work.
    
The Talent Team is relentless about diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging, and applies that lens to every piece of our work. We invite all interested individuals to apply and encourage applications from people with disabilities, Indigenous, Black, and racialized individuals, as well as people from a diversity of ethnic and cultural origins, sexual orientations, gender identities and expressions. We also acknowledge that knowledge and experience can be gained in many ways, not simply through traditional schooling, and encourage applications from all individuals who feel they are a good fit for the role.

Note: This position is located at the address listed on the job advertisement, however alternate work arrangements, including telework, may be available.

## What can I expect to do in this role?
In this role you will:
-   Play a critical role not only in the development but, most importantly, the implementation of the ODS and enterprise digital talent strategy and have an opportunity to get your hands dirty supporting the full scope of people processes to attract, onboard, develop, engage, and retain high-performing employees.    
-   Provide advice and recommendations to the ODS leadership team and ministry partners on leading digital talent practices and industry trends to ensure that we're always moving the bar and challenging ourselves to try new things in all aspects of our work.    
-   Provide leadership in the development and implementation of policy, strategy, and tactics that help build digital talent in the ODS and across the public service, and work with senior leaders and executives to help bring those policies and strategies to fruition.
    
## How do I qualify?
### Consultation, Relationship Management and Communication Skills:
-   You are customer-service oriented with a track record of building strong relationships.    
-   You have strong acuity and are able to use your knowledge and expertise to advise, influence change and address diverse client and stakeholder issues and concerns.    
-   You have an understanding of user research and its importance to creating policies, products, and processes that respond to user needs and market trends through continuous, iterative improvement.    
-   You have strong verbal and written communication skills and are comfortable preparing reports and delivering presentations to diverse audiences including senior leaders.
    
### Strategic Planning and Project Management Skills:
-   You have strong project management and strategic planning skills to lead transformation and change initiatives.    
-   You can effectively lead a range of concurrent projects from conceptualization to development, implementation and evaluation.
    
### Conceptual and Analytical Skills:
-   You have analytical skills to assess complex issues and develop innovative responses, options and solutions.    
-   You have proven experience as a detail-oriented, conceptual thinker with strong research skills to understand and analyze complicated issues in view of applicable legislation, directives, policies, and guidelines.
    
### Human Resources and Labour Relations Knowledge:
-   You have experience in, and understanding of, recruiting for technical roles in a competitive environment.    
-   You have a basic understanding of and willingness to further explore Human Resources (HR) management and Labour Relations (LR) principles, best practices, procedures, relevant acts, regulations, standards, and contracts in areas such as recruitment, retention, training and development and organizational development.
