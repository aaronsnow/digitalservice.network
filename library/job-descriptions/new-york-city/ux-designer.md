# UX Designer
Proposed Salary Range: $94,283 – $120,000 (Annual)

### JOB DESCRIPTION
Equity and inclusion is central to the NYC Digital Service. We are looking for a UX Designer who has a keen sense of design and is passionate about accessibility, language access, user-centered design, and responsiveness. The UX designer consistently and persistently advocates for the needs of our main users: New Yorkers.

The UX Designer does a lot of user research and prototyping in collaboration with the Design Lab Director. They will need to be familiar with collaborative design tools like Figma in order to deliver value quickly to our stakeholders.

A normal day for the UX Designer would be taking part in user interviews and research, building prototypes and showing it in user interviews and to stakeholders. You will be collaborating with the development team in building the application through the designs you have made in Figma. They will be deeply involved with the design lifecycle from iterating the designs based on user feedback, to going pixel by pixel with the frontend developers in making sure that every component looks good. You will test the digital tools’ accessibility and language access, filing bug tickets if the aria-label is off, the text-to-voice sequencing isn’t correct, or that the Arabic left-to-right formatting is off.

Your vision is what gets turned into code, and will eventually turn into a full-fledged digital service for New Yorkers. Your success will mean that everyone — and we mean everyone — receives the best digital service New York City can offer. You are on the frontlines of New York City’s digital transformation.
