# Full-Stack Web Developer
Proposed Salary Range: $58,700 – $120,000 (Annual)

### JOB DESCRIPTION
The full-stack web developers for the NYC Digital Service aim to empower New Yorkers through code. We are looking for someone who wants to deliver digital tools that bring value and service to all New Yorkers.

There are over 100 city agencies and offices in New York City, often with their own sets of coding practices. NYC Digital Service aims to support and collaborate with these agencies, so we are looking for an innovator who has a wide knowledge of various web development practices.

We’re looking for folks who can serve the breadth of coding needs of the city: two web developers who can cover backend needs in various Java and Python frameworks, as well as front end development in React or Angular, HTML, Javascript, and CSS. Usually, frontend development would also include using mapping & visualization libraries. So knowledge on these libraries as well as other Javascript frameworks are a plus.

Our team will sometimes be embedded into a city agency’s dev team. Being collaborative is key. We are looking for someone who is keen both in building good code as well as fostering a good community and culture with fellow technologists. As the Founding Member of NYC Digital Services, you set the tone for what an accessible, equity-focused, and inclusive digital service looks like. By having a clear vision of equity and inclusion in our digital service, your work will reverberate to the wider tech community.

A normal day would be working on development tickets, coding both backend and frontend. You will be part of product-delivery strategy sessions with our partner agencies. Sometimes, you will be embedded in a partner-agency’s tech team, learning about their coding culture and help set them up for success. You understand that an agency’s success will be a success for all New Yorkers.
