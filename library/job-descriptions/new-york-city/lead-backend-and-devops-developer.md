# Lead Backend and DevOps Developer
Proposed Salary Range: $72,038 – $150,000 (Annual)

### JOB DESCRIPTION
The newly formed New York City Digital Service is looking for a founding member of its team to serve as Lead Backend and DevOps Developer. This person is passionate about building good foundations for digital tools, and is focused on building a strong backend, database, infrastructure, and pipelines to build digital tools and improving existing ones.

We are looking for someone who understands that the products we build for the 8.8 million New Yorkers need to scale, someone who has a clear vision of what effective and efficient infrastructure for the public good looks like. At the same time, this person will lead and navigate the various architecture/infrastructure requirements and accreditation processes in order to launch products in city government.

The NYC Digital Service works with various city agencies, each with their own tech stack. It’s important that you’re knowledgeable in both Azure and AWS. Security is at the center of our work — we won’t launch anything without proper security accreditation — so familiarity with security protocols and tools like Veracode is a plus.

A normal day would be spinning up a Load Balancer Sandwich in AWS in order for us to keep code and service inside the city’s intranet, making sure that a product being hosted in Azure AppService passes security accreditation, implementing CI/CD in coordination with the Product Manager and Lead Web Developer. There will be times where we will need you to take on some Java or Python tasks (whichever you’re comfortable with) when we need more coding capacity. You will be in constant communication with the City’s CloudServices team, as well as the NYC Cyber Command during security accreditation.
