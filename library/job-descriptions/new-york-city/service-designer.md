# Service Designer
Proposed salary range: $58,700 – $120,000 Commensurate with Experience (Annual)

User-centered design in government is complex because services in government are complex. The NYC Digital Service is looking for a Service Designer who is passionate about making sense of complex systems, with the ability to elegantly map things as they are today, and —  in collaboration with the Design Lab — propose transformative improvements that leverage digital technologies in ways that seamlessly align with broader end-to-end experience. If you love working on complex projects that positively impact people at scale, this is the job for you. 

The Service Designer will be particularly focused on government systems, both inside NYC, and at times, also the state and federal governments. More broadly, this work may also consider how other systems, for instance, charities or healthcare, and their impact, overlap or intersect services.

The Service Designer does a lot of user research, ecosystem mapping, blueprints and workshops. A normal day for the Service Designer would be scheduling and taking part in user interviews and research, developing a blueprint, and socializing findings with stakeholders. 

Service Design projects will support the Design Lab, and development teams’ efforts to build user centered service. To this end, you will be deeply involved with the design lifecycle, in particular, supporting designs for onboarding, offboarding, and end-to-end design. 

Your success will mean that everyone — and we mean everyone — receives the best digital service New York City can offer. In particular, your unique contribution to the team will ensure that although users are engaging with America’s largest municipal government, the experience feels simple, seamless and intuitive.  


This role is on the frontline of New York City’s digital transformation, a once in a generation opportunity. If you are interested in elegant digital services, where equity and inclusion is front of mind, click to apply below.
