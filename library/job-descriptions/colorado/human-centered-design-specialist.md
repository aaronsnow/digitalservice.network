# Description of Job

## Agency and Product Background
Colorado is launching a new Universal Preschool program. The program will provide preschool services to children. Investing in early childhood is essential to supporting working families, child development, and a prosperous economy. The window from birth to age 5 is critical in a child’s development. In the first few years of life, more than 1 million new neural connections form every second. The experiences children have in the first five years of their life lay the foundation for their future.

The Universal Preschool Program aims to provide an easy-to-use, simple to navigate experience to help families understand how many hours they qualify for, providers they have access to, and to submit an application for preschool services. This is the first step in a larger vision to support early childhood services from birth to five through the new Department of Early Childhood.
