Building on the February 2022 report [Benefit Eligibility Rules as Code: Reducing the Gap Between Policy and Service Delivery for the Safety Net](https://beeckcenter.georgetown.edu/report/benefit-eligibility-rules-as-code/), our Beeck Center sibling org the [Digital Benefits Network](https://beeckcenter.georgetown.edu/projects/digital-benefits-network/) is holding a full day of live online-only demonstration sessions of projects and code that are advancing the digitization of eligibility rules and the delivery of public benefits, followed by a collaborative problem solving session on how to advance rules as code for the U.S. social safety net.
