The DOL today released [open source sample code](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/ui-modernization#sample-code) for implementing important pieces of the unemployment insurance systems they require states to implement -- including state integration wth [login.gov](https://login.gov).

This is important, valuable precedent for changing how the federal government supports the policies it leaves to the states to implement.

If you're working on a state's UI implementation, [let us know](mailto:hi@digitalservice.network)! Here at the Beeck Center, the [Intergovernmental Software Collaborative](https://softwarecollaborative.org) and [Digital Benefits Network](https://beeckcenter.georgetown.edu/projects/digital-benefits-network/) teams are working with federal and state folks on various pieces of that puzzle; we'd love to help, and to hear more about how that's going for you and your state.
