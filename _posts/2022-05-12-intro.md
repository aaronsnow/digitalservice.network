Hello DSN World! (_This is a randomly selected excerpt from other materials -- let's update this_) The DSN is a supported community of practice that fosters collaboration and maximizes the capacity of Digital Service teams. With co-designed and peer-based resource sharing, policy advocacy, training, and technical assistance, digital service is being institutionalized as core to the way governments work to serve people. While the government digital service teams are focused on building their services and methodologies, there is an opportunity to document their work in order to learn from these experiences, share lessons and best practices more widely, and support digital service teams as they adapt to evolving public needs.
